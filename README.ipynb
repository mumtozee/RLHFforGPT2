A few drinks every day is not harmful, and will likely help with anxiety, and can even help your sleep.

Your nervous system can get really messed up if you drink so much alcohol, especially if you have a lot of anxiety, or other mental health issues.  You can try to relax and take some sleeping pills to help your body and brain relax faster, and it’s a great idea to get some rest each night.  If you’re going to do a lot of drinking, you need to think about the negative consequences, so take caution about how much you drink and what happens to you if you overdo it.  I recommend you don’t feel like you have to make any changes.
